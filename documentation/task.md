# Task

Tasks are defined processes which complete a piece of work. They are typically configured via a wolfkrow.yml file, and are 
initialized via the loader. However, they can also be initialized manually by instantiating the class with all TaskAttributes required as kwargs.

Every task definition has it's own TaskAttributes, but all Tasks should inherit a base level of TaskAttributes from the Task class.

# Default TaskAttributes

TODO: This list should be autogenerated from the TaskAttributes descriptions.

* name (Optional): The name of the task
* dependencies (Optional): List of the names of other tasks this task depends on.
* replacements (Optional): Dictionary of key value pairs to pass into the resolver in order to resolve {key} style string values in other TaskAttributes.
* resolver_search_paths (Optional): List of paths to pass into the resolver.
* config_files (Optional): List of wolfkrow.yml files which were used to configure this task. Used to reconstruct the Wolfkrow configuration after export. 
* temp_dir (Optional): Temp directory to write files to. Used for both the task's custom logic and the task's exported files.
* sgtk (Optional): SGTK configuration instance. Used to enable SGTK integration. Mainly SGTKTEMPLATE<> style replacements in the resolver.
